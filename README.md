# InstagramViewerApp
A basic application which can display the posts of an instagram account if the app is given the appropriate access token.
The app contains 2 screens:
1. A horizontal list of posts with the date of the post and caption displayed.
2. A vertical list for those posts which are albums. These can be accessed by tapping on the post. A post is an album if the appropriate icon is displayed over the image on the bottom left.
